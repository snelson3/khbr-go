WIP

Program for randomizing KH2 boss/enemy locations, patching using the OpenKH Mod Manager. It aims to be fully compatible with Valaxor's GOA Randomizer (except of course the enemy part of that randomizer)

Currently:
Use the python program randomizer.py to generate a .khbr file listing the enemy replacements
Set your openkh and kh2 extracted iso directories
Run the executable with the .khbr file as an argument
Open Mod Manager and select the mod folder that gets generated here

Future Plans
Improvements to KHBR boss/enemy randomizer, more bosses included in randomization and bugfixes
Proof of Concept randomizers for KH1/KHBBS/KHDDD/KH3
Slay the Spire inspired Boss Rush mod/generator for KH1/KH2/KH3/KHDDD/KHBBS
Website for downloading khbr files, instead of python script
